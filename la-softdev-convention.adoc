== Convention Target

The Software Development and Build Convention for LoongArch Architectures is primarily targeted at Linux desktop operating systems, Linux server operating systems and Linux embedded operating systems.

== Chip Feature Compatibility Requirements

=== CPUCFG instruction
The CPU needs to support the CPUCFG instruction and follow the convention of the CPUCFG instruction described in https://loongson.github.io/LoongArch-Documentation/LoongArch-Vol1-EN.html#_cpucfg[__LoongArch Architecture Reference Manual Volume 1__]. CPUCFG.1.bit25 equals 1 is used to determine whether the CRC instruction is supported.The CPU reads the lower 8 bits of the 0-offset address through the IOCSR method, and the return value is not 0 indicating that it supports the chip configuration version register, feature register, manufacturer name register and chip name register. The definitions of each register are as follows.

=== Device Driver Compatibility
The internal functional module register interface of the CPU needs to ensure compatibility between chips.

- For non-PCI devices of the CPU or bridge chip, their register definitions need to ensure forward compatibility to ensure the normal use of their basic functions by the kernel. For example, non-PCI devices currently used by the kernel include: interrupt controllers (traditional interrupts, extended interrupts), UART, PWM, ACPI, RTC, GPIO.
- For PCI devices, identification is done through Vendor ID, Device ID, and Revision ID, and software compatibility under the same ID needs to be ensured.

=== Vector instruction support
Desktop and server chips default to supporting 128-bit vector instructions.

=== Unaligned memory access support
Desktop and server chips default to supporting unaligned memory access.


== Compiler constraints

=== Compiler constraints for desktop and server operating systems

When building desktop and server operating systems, developers should enable the -mno-strict-align compilation option of the compiler by default.

=== Compiler constraints for embedded operating systems

When building an embedded operating system, developers should enable the -mstrict-align compilation option of the compiler by default.

=== Architecture-related C/C++ pre-defined macros.

== Kernel Constraints

=== Kernel Development

The kernel needs to obtain CPU features through CPUCFG instruction, and the application obtains CPU features through the getauxval system call provided by the kernel.

(1)The kernel needs to support the corresponding functions based on the CPUCFG instruction and CPU feature registers, to achieve compatible operation on different model CPUs using the same kernel binary;

(2)The kernel exports the CPU features supported by the system through HWCAP (a 32-bit unsigned data), and application software identifies the CPU features supported by the system based on HWCAP. HWCAP is defined as follows:

| Bit Field | Meaning                                      
| 0         | Supports cpucfg instruction                  
| 1         | Supports atomic instructions                 
| 2         | Supports unaligned access                    
| 3         | Supports single/double precision FP          
| 4         | Supports 128-bit vector extension            
| 5         | Supports 256-bit vector extension            
| 6         | Supports 32-bit CRC instruction              
| 7         | Supports complex vector operation instruction
| 8         | Supports cryptographic vector instruction    
| 9         | Supports virtualization extension            
| 10        | Supports x86 binary translation extension    
| 11        | Supports ARM binary translation extension    
| 12        | Supports MIPS binary translation extension   
|==========================================================

Applications can use HWCAP as follows:

The CPU characteristic data can be obtained through getauxval(AT_HWCAP), and the corresponding CPU characteristic can be detected according to the HWCAP definition.

(3)The kernel exports CPU information through /proc/cpuinfo, which is only used for display and not for application software's CPU feature detection. The format of cpuinfo is as follows:

|==========================================================================================================================================

=== Kernel Build

For desktop and server operating systems, the kernel defaults to supporting non-aligned access builds.

For embedded operating systems, the kernel needs to be built with the -mstrict-align compilation option for aligned access.

== Operating System Package Build Requirements

=== Desktop and Server Operating System Build Requirements

Desktop operating systems need to support CPU platforms with at least 128-bit vector units.

The desktop operating system compilation toolchain should enable the -mno-strict-align compilation option by default and disable auto-vectorization.

=== Embedded Operating System Requirements

Embedded operating systems need to support CPU platforms without vector units.

The embedded operating system compilation toolchain should enable the -mstrict-align compilation option by default and disable auto-vectorization.


== Compatibility Requirements for Software Development

=== Extended Instruction Recognition
New extended instructions should be identified using getauxval.For the specific usage method of getauxval and the meaning of parameters, please refer to xref:_kernel_development[_Kernel Development_].

=== Compiler Vector Instruction Support Detection
To ensure compatibility, vectorization should at least consider checking the characteristics of the compiler and runtime platform. During compilation, check that the compiler supports the vector instruction set before compiling the binary with vectorization enabled. During runtime, check that the runtime platform supports the vector instruction set before initializing/registering the corresponding optimization interface.

=== Compile-time and Runtime Checks
Compatibility should also be considered for microstructure or differences between different instruction set versions, and both compile-time and runtime checks should be implemented.

=== Compatibility of LA32R and LA64
LA32R and LA64 are compatible. Since there are differences in the underlying integer instruction sets between the two, developers are advised to abstract the required basic integer instructions as macros and point them to specific instructions on different platforms.
